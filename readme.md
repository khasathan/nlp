nlp
----
This is tool for Natural Language Processing (NLP), it's customized to use
for my several works.

Previously, I used NLTK to processed tasks about tokenize,
clean html tags but it didn't work well for me. I started written my own
algorithm and added some rules to make it works better.

It's works for me, I hope it's works for you too.

## What does this project offer?
- Tokenizer - sentence tokenizer, word tokenzier.
- Regular Expression utility - combine list patterns then compile to regular

and syntax like English should be fine).
